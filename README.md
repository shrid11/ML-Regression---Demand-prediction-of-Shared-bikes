# ML-Regression---Demand-prediction-of-Shared-bikes


Analysing the Dataset to understand the variables to predict the demand for the Shared bikes.
Essentially, the company BoomBikes wants â€”
1.To identify the variables affecting demand for the Shared bikes. i.e Season, Day of the week, Weekend, Holiday etc.
2.To create a linear model that quantitatively relates Demand with variables such as Climate, Weather etc
3.To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict the demand for the Shared bikes
